# Light_Sources_Examples
Software examples for Thorlabs products that emit light

## Repo Organization
All examples are split up by programming language and product type. Directions on using specific examples are given within the folders.

### C\# and C++ Soft Requirements

Guides written for these examples are written with Microsoft's Visual Studio in mind, which can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
Other IDEs can be used, but instructions are not provided in this repository. Examples using dependencies not included in the .NET Framework will be called out on the build instructions for each program.


### Python Requirements

Python examples make use of the Ctypes module or the pySerial module, which can be installed using the command

```
pip install ctypes
```
and
```
pip install pyserial
```
